# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

## Lasso

## Support Vector Machine
1. I install the "quadprog" package and utilize the function "solve.QP" to solve SVM. The "solve.QP" function is trying to perform the minimizing problem.
$$df$$
2. 

## Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator for a one dimensional problem
## A one-dimensional adaboost using a stump model as the weak learner
## Sliced inverse regression
